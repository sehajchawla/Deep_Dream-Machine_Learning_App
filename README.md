# Deep Dream - Machine Learning App
This project is a implementation of the popular deep dream algorithm that uses tensorflow to combine neural nets with images for trippy visuals.

The output is fantastic, and is in the PNG file as always.

The idea behind the algorithm is taking a hidden layer and superimposing it with an existing image by applying gradient ascent to make it as simiar to the input image as possible.
